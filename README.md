# HotelExercise
Just a quick Readme for Hotel Project 

A little bit of this project:

- For our hotel booking system, we practice making a module full of business logic that tracks which rooms are reserved, and at what dates. This was organized into appropriate classes and methods.

We also use tests to verify that this system works as intended.

We were expected to:

- Make decisions on how we structure our classes and methods
- Ask questions when we needed clarification
- Understand that the way we implement something may be different than the way a neighbor implements it
